# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Go module: `github.com/hasanMshawrab/bitslack`
Go version: 1.24.2

A Go **library** that receives Bitbucket webhook events and forwards them to Slack as **threaded messages** — all events for a given PR appear as replies under the original message rather than as new top-level messages.

Consumers embed this library into their own server and wire it up by providing adapter implementations. The library defines interfaces; callers supply the concrete backends.

## Common Commands

```bash
make check                            # Full check: build + vet + lint + arch-lint + test
make build                            # Build all packages
make test                             # Run all tests (excluding e2e)
make test-unit                        # Run unit tests only (internal/)
make test-integration                 # Run integration tests (handler)
make lint                             # Run golangci-lint
make lint-fix                         # Run golangci-lint with auto-fix
make arch-lint                        # Run architecture dependency linter
make fmt                              # Format code (goimports + golines)
make tools                            # Install pinned dev tools
go test ./internal/... -run TestName  # Run a single test by name
```

### Key boundaries

- **Public surface** (`bitslack.go`, `adapter.go`, `handler.go`) — everything a consumer needs to import and wire up. Keep this minimal and stable.
- **`internal/`** — all implementation details. Nothing in `internal/` is importable by consumers. Each sub-package has a single clear responsibility.
- **`examples/`** — the only place that may use concrete third-party adapter implementations. The core library never depends on them.
- **`testdata/`** — Go test convention; files here are accessible via `os.Open("testdata/...")` in tests without any path manipulation.

## Architecture

### Adapter / Plugin Model

The library is backend-agnostic. Consumers construct the core engine by injecting adapters that satisfy these interfaces:

- **ConfigStore** — provides repo→channel mapping and Bitbucket account ID→Slack user ID lookup. The library only calls lookup methods (`GetChannel`, `GetSlackUserID`); it never loads or caches data itself. The consumer controls their own data lifecycle — preloading, caching, or fetching on demand is entirely up to them. `GetSlackUserID` accepts a Bitbucket `account_id` (not `nickname`) because `account_id` is stable across webhook payloads and REST API responses, whereas `nickname` is user-editable and inconsistent between the two sources.
- **ThreadStore** — stores and retrieves the PR→Slack thread `ts` mapping. Needs TTL support (30-day expiry per PR). Could be backed by Redis, Memcached, an in-process map, etc.
- **Logger** — structured logging with three methods: `Info(message string)`, `Warn(message string)`, `Error(message string)`. If none is provided, the library defaults to a no-op logger.

The library ships no concrete adapter implementations — those live in the caller's codebase or in separate companion packages.

### Opening Message Format

The first message posted for a PR (either on `pullrequest:created` or backfilled) must display:
- **Repository** name
- **PR title**
- **PR number** — rendered as a clickable Slack link (`<URL|#id>`)
- **Author** — Slack @mention if an account ID mapping exists, otherwise plain Bitbucket nickname
- **Reviewers** — each as a Slack @mention if mapped, otherwise plain nickname

Each field appears on its own line with a bold label (e.g. `*PR Title:* …`). The metadata fields (repository, title, PR number) are grouped in one Block Kit section; the people fields (author, reviewers) in a second section.

### Opening Message Updates

The opening message is a live document — it is edited (via `chat.update`) to stay in sync with PR state changes:

- `pullrequest:updated` — if the title or reviewer list changed, update the opening message in place
- **Adding a reviewer** — edit the message to add their @mention; Slack will automatically notify them (no separate notification needed)
- **Removing a reviewer** — edit the message to remove their @mention; Slack will not notify them of the removal. If they have not yet engaged with the thread (no reply, no click-through), they will stop receiving future thread notifications. If they have already engaged, Slack marks them as a thread follower and they will continue to receive updates regardless — this is a known Slack limitation.

### Core Flow

1. Caller's HTTP server receives a Bitbucket webhook and calls `client.Handler(ctx, eventKey, payload)`.
2. The library checks the event's family against `Config.EnabledEvents`. If the family is not enabled, log a `Warn` and return nil (soft-drop).
3. The library parses the event and identifies the PR (see "Build Status Events" below).
4. Look up the Slack channel via `ConfigStore.GetChannel(repo)`.
5. Look up the thread `ts` for that PR via `ThreadStore`.
6. If no `ts` exists (new PR **or** an existing PR that predates the integration):
   - Call the Bitbucket API to fetch full PR details (`GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo}/pullrequests/{id}`)
   - Post a synthetic opening message to Slack → store the returned `ts` via `ThreadStore`
   - If either step fails, log the error and drop the event gracefully (no panic, no partial state)
7. Event-specific behavior:
   - `pullrequest:created` — the opening message IS the notification; no separate reply is posted
   - `pullrequest:updated` — edit the opening message via `chat.update`; no reply posted
   - All other PR and commit_status events — post as a threaded reply using `thread_ts`
   - Pipeline events — see "Pipeline Events" below

### Error Handling

- **Hard errors** (malformed JSON for recognized event keys) — returned to the caller.
- **Soft errors** (API failures, store failures, missing channel) — logged and swallowed, returning nil. This ensures the consumer can always respond 200 to Bitbucket, preventing retry storms.

### Build Status Events

Bitbucket `repo:commit_status_created` / `repo:commit_status_updated` events do **not** include a PR ID — only a commit hash. To resolve the PR, call the Bitbucket API:

```
GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo}/commit/{hash}/pullrequests
```

### Pipeline Events

`pipeline:span_created` delivers an OpenTelemetry trace. Only `bbc.pipeline_run` spans are processed; `bbc.pipeline_step`, `bbc.command`, and `bbc.container` spans are silently skipped.

**Repository resolution:** Real Bitbucket OTel payloads omit `pipeline.repository.full_name` and only include `pipeline.repository.uuid` and `pipeline.account.uuid`. When `full_name` is absent, the handler resolves the repository via the Bitbucket API:
```
GET /repositories/{accountUUID}/{repoUUID}
```
The `account.uuid` is used as the workspace identifier (Bitbucket accepts UUIDs in place of slugs). The resolved `full_name` is then used for all subsequent channel and thread lookups.

**Result values:** OTel `pipeline.state.result.name` uses different values than the REST API. The mapping is: `COMPLETE` → ✅, `FAILED` → ❌, `ERROR` → 🔴, `STOPPED` → ⏹. These differ from `repo:commit_status_*` which uses `SUCCESSFUL`/`FAILED`/`INPROGRESS`.

**Run URL:** The `pipeline_run.url` span attribute is used directly as the link in the Slack message.

PR linkage for pipeline events:
- If `pipeline.target.ref_type = BRANCH`: call the Bitbucket API to find the open PR for that branch:
  ```
  GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo}/pullrequests?q=source.branch.name="{branch}"&state=OPEN
  ```
  This avoids the shared-commit-hash ambiguity of commit_status events, where a hash present on multiple branches could match the wrong PR thread.
- If a PR is found: post the pipeline result as a threaded reply (backfilling opening message if needed). The backfill path calls `GetPullRequest` (single-resource endpoint) after `GetOpenPRForBranch`, because Bitbucket's list endpoint omits the `reviewers` field — the full PR details are required to build a complete opening message.
- If no PR is found, or `ref_type = TAG`: post a standalone top-level message to the repo channel.

Consumers using Bitbucket Pipelines should enable `EventFamilyPipeline` and omit `EventFamilyCommitStatus` — Bitbucket Pipelines fires commit statuses too, and enabling both produces duplicate Slack messages for the same pipeline run.

### Slack Integration

Uses `chat.postMessage` with the `thread_ts` field to post replies into an existing thread.

The caller provides tokens at construction time — the library has no opinion on how they are stored or retrieved:

```go
client := bitslack.New(bitslack.Config{
    SlackToken:       "xoxb-...",
    BitbucketUsername: "user@example.com",
    BitbucketToken:   "atlassian-api-token",
    // adapters...
})
```

- **Slack**: Bot token (`xoxb-...`). Required OAuth scopes: `chat:write`. Add `chat:write.public` if the bot needs to post to channels it hasn't been explicitly invited to.
- **Bitbucket**: Atlassian API token with `read:repository:bitbucket` and `read:pullrequest:bitbucket` scopes. Uses HTTP Basic auth (username + token).

### Testing Strategy

All tests run offline with zero external dependencies:

- **Unit** — test event parsing (`internal/event/`), message formatting (`internal/format/`), and API client behavior (`internal/slack/`, `internal/bitbucket/`) using `httptest` stubs.
- **Integration** — `handler_test.go` tests the full public API flow using real fixture JSON files, mock adapters (`internal/testutil/`), and `httptest` servers for Slack and Bitbucket APIs. This is the most important test layer.
- **E2E** — scaffolded in `examples/server/e2e_test.go` behind `//go:build e2e` tag for future use with the docker-compose stack.

### Event Families and Opt-In

Consumers declare which event families to handle via `Config.EnabledEvents`. Defaults to `[EventFamilyPullRequest]` if unset. Events from disabled families are soft-dropped (Warn log, nil return).

```go
client := bitslack.New(bitslack.Config{
    // ...
    EnabledEvents: []bitslack.EventFamily{
        bitslack.EventFamilyPullRequest,
        bitslack.EventFamilyCommitStatus,
    },
})
```

Consumers using Bitbucket Pipelines should enable `EventFamilyPipeline` and omit `EventFamilyCommitStatus` — Bitbucket Pipelines fires both, so enabling both produces duplicate notifications.

### Supported Webhook Events

- `pullrequest:created`
- `pullrequest:updated`

- `repo:commit_status_updated`

**Pipeline** (`EventFamilyPipeline` — opt-in)
- `pipeline:span_created` (only `bbc.pipeline_run` spans; step/command/container spans are skipped)
